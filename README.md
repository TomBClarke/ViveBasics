# Vive Basics

A basic Unity project for the HTC Vive, with basic assests and settings configured.

VR is booming at the moment, and as a way to potentially prepare myself for a 'final year project' at university based on the HTC Vive, I'm making this repository as a way to show the basic setup needed for Vive development in Unity.

This project should achieve:

* Enabling the HMD and hand controls.
* Teleporting around a small area.
* Utilising the visual package supplied by Valve (based off of 'The Labs' visuals).
* An easy way to build basic terrain.

## Future Targets ##

* Realistic physics for picking up and moving objects.
